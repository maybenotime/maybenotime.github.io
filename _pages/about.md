I am an incoming Ph.D. student in [GrUVi Lab](https://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca/) & [3DLG-HCVC](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/) at Simon Fraser University (SFU), supervised by [Prof. Angel Xuan Chang](https://angelxuanchang.github.io/). I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Beijing Language and Cultural University (BLCU). 
Previously, I worked as an intern at Peking University and Algorithm R&D Department of TAL.
And I was privileged to have been advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/) during my research internship at Peking University.



Research Interests
======
My research interests mainly concentrate on Natural Language Processing. Here are some directions my previous work covered.

* Constructing new Benchmarks for low-resource language and emerging NLP domains through crowdsourcing and LLMs annotator.

* Exploiting Transfer Learning and Self-Supervised Learning to enhance the performance and robustness of models in various NLP tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios.

* Investigating the drawbacks of large language models, such as Hallucinations and the Reversal Curse, to develop strategies for building trustworthy and responsible LLMs.

Recently, my research focus has been drawn towards the Hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in multilingual scenarios. I am also interested in Multimodal Language Models and the application of LLMs on various domains.
