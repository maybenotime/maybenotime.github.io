CCL2022 Evaluation Task — The fourth NiuTrans Cup humor computing [\[Code\]](https://github.com/maybenotime/CCL2022_humor_computing)
======
* This evaluation task is divided into two tracks: \textbf{humor recognition} and \textbf{humor response generation} in dialogue scenarios. We rank top at both tracks and win the \textbf{First Prize} finally.
* For humor recognition, we explore sentence-based text classification, \textbf{dialogue modeling}, and \textbf{prompt-based} text classification. We conduct experiments using various \textbf{BERT variants} and apply a range of \textbf{tricks}. Then, we ensemble heterogeneous models through a \textbf{stacking} approach to further improve the performance.
* For humor response generation, we design a \textbf{sliding window strategy} to perform \textbf{data augmentation} and conduct experiments on GPT2 and T5. Furthermore, we utilize the humor recognition model to \textbf{select humorous response} from sampled results.

Hard-Constrained Text Generation with Controllable Word Complexity (Thesis) [\[Code\]](https://github.com/maybenotime/BLCU2022_Undergraduate_Thesis)
======
* We proposed Diff-Transferer, an any-speaker text-to-speech model with a shallow diffusion mechanism; stabilized the traning process of the diffusion model and reduced the number of training steps needed to reach convergence.

Reverse Dictionary in Chinese
======
* We crawled information of NLP papers in recent three years from semantic scholar API; extracted keywords from the abstract of each paper and conducted unsupervised topic clustering; analyzed the authors’ collaboration relationship with Neo4j; analyzed the combination of different topics with co-occurrence heatmap
